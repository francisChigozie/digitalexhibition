            My name is Chigozie Francis.I have a National
            Higher Diploma in Computer <br>Science.I speak English fluently
            and German well enough to communicate and <br>understand you
            (" flie√üend ").<br>
            After the last covid-2019 experience, I have witnessed how
            helpful the Internet <br>was to people during the lock-downs.
            I have taken some University-courses <br>about Web Interface
            Design and I have received professional training <br>(Coding Boot Camp) to
            becoming a Web and App Developer.
